# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Quarantine Body Building 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Design a fitness plan that someone could do from their bedroom/dorm. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

	As COVID cases reach record highs in the United States and the smaller Yale community struggles as students are forced indoors, the need for safe but effective at home/dorm workout rises. We propose to meet this unique challenge by creating a website that designs body weight workouts that one can do in his or her bedroom. Choosing from a variety of exercises, this website will design biweekly workout plans for the user based on their fitness goals. After registering, users will have access to flexible workout designs tha
t accommodate their personal needs. 

Basic Outline:
Register the users in a database 
Have set database of exercises to choose from 
Allow user to input personal fitness goals 
    Number of reps per exercise 
    Date they want to accomplish their goals by 
    Number of workouts per week 
    Length of each workout 
Include pre-written workout plans user can choose from
Each workout should track number of reps desired vs. actually completed 
Give the user a feedback form after each workout to adjust following workouts/plan


## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

Vivian Weng

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Create and format website
Register users
Have database with exercises to choose from

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Give the user a feedback form after each workout to adjust the following workouts/plan
Add in prewritten workout plans

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Make the site interactive, create a community for the users to share their progress and interact
Create leaderboard for different workouts/exercises 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next Steps: 
Finding exercises that can be done in a dorm room 
This website would involve a lot of user interaction so diving more in depth with JavaScript would be helpful 
Task Allocation: 
Vivian will focus on creating databases of potential workouts and exercises
Claire will focus on formatting the website so that the user view is cohesive and easy to follow
